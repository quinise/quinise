  # Hello, World!
</p>



I was inspired to code by my math teacher at the University of Michigan. She was a petite Black woman like me and she **owned** each explanation she gave. Her lessons were clear and her teaching was patient. I strive do be those things as I create with a keyboard.

In the past, my fear of getting the wrong answer stopped me from programming. I didn’t know where to turn, seeing no-one like me in the field around me. I paused and stammered my way through phone screens, failing every opportunity that I got. It wasn’t until after programming bootcamp that I became more comfortable with sitting down and working on a project. My fear started to subside and I started networking with people.

Today, I am powerful in my confidence to explain technical concepts. I am interested in how technical pieces come together to make successful solutions. Bringing a diverse, human aspect to programming excites me. To succeed at writing code I will gather my experiences and work diligently with others.
